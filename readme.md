2. Based on "ALTENTEK WarShip STM32 Board v2.2" 
3. Device: stm32f103zet6

This project is not well structured...
STM32CubeMx makes it easy to build a HID application. For complete and safe HID application, ST usb hid lib will be a better choice.

There are some problems when sending data in interrupt..
